# Afk Arema bot (First project)
## History of project
I started learning Java language in 2022 7 September. After I mastered the basic syntax of the Java language, I began to learn Object oriented programming. I had a lack of practice to master OOP, so I decided to start making my own pet project. And I decided to create Telegram bot for me, what can calculate my resources for the future considering many factors. It took 2 month for learning basic knowledges of Java.
## Bot Functionality
Bot has several commands that could calculate game currencies of
**Labyrinth**, **Tournament**, **TwistedRealm**, **Bait**.

The bot takes into account events that double resources, it's all written in the class "EventsDeterminator".

The bot takes into account the data about the user and his donation, in accordance with it, he counts the resources.

## Insides
I think my code in some places needs a little bit of refactoring, but since this is my first project, I think it's forgivable :)
